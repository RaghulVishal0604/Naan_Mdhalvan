# GAN Image Generation

## Introduction

This repository hosts the code for generating synthetic images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The GAN model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, aiming to produce images that closely resemble real CIFAR-10 images.

## Features

- **High Fidelity:** The GAN model generates images with a high degree of fidelity, closely resembling real CIFAR-10 images.
- **Diverse Outputs:** The model produces diverse outputs across different classes, capturing the variety present in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Quality Metrics:** Quality metrics are provided to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated images.
- **Stable Training:** The training process is designed to be stable, ensuring consistent improvement of the model over time.
- **Successful Applications:** Users have reported successful applications in data augmentation tasks and creative projects.
- **Educational Impact:** The model serves as an educational tool, facilitating learning and experimentation in the field of AI and deep learning.
- **Innovation Potential:** The results obtained from this model inspire further exploration and innovation in the realm of artificial intelligence.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. **Installation:** Clone this repository and install the required dependencies using `pip`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gan-image-generation.git
    cd gan-image-generation
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Training:** Train the GAN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset:

    ```bash
    python train.py --dataset_path /path/to/cifar-10 --epochs 100 --batch_size 64
    ```

3. **Generation:** Generate synthetic images using the trained model:

    ```bash
    python generate_images.py --checkpoint_path /path/to/checkpoint --output_dir /path/to/output --num_images 100
    ```

4. **Results:** Check the output directory for the generated images and evaluate their quality using metrics such as Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance.
